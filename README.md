# Getting_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project
This repository is created as part of the Course Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. It contains files used for cleaning data and the tidy data generated.

The file "CodeBook.md" describes the variables, the data and the transformations done to produce a tidy dataset.

The file "run_analysis.R" contains the code that downloads the data from the source and performs the transformations that produce the tidy dataset.

The file "tidydata.txt" is the independent tidy data produced from running the "run_analysis.R" script
